# Take Notes for Class

I was having trouble finding platform where I could effectively take notes for school deadlines. I usually have my laptop out in class and wanted an easy way to write down my deadlines, and although there exist some apps online like Notion, I felt they were too heavy-duty; I wanted something much simpler. I decided to make this project with React and TypeScript. I've really been enjoying adding TypeScript to my recent React projects. I feel like the type-checking and the silly bugs I catch at compile time make the code a lot more readable and the development process smoother.
